SETTING UP:
First, change the file to a .cpp instead of an image file and run it through a compiler, such as Developer Prompt for Visual Studio 2022.
Once compiled, change the .exe file that is as result of compiling back to .IMAGE, this allows it to be a Macintosh program.

INSTALLATION:
To get the program onto a Macintosh, copy the .IMAGE file onto a diskette, along with the READ ME.txt if you need it.
The diskette is now Macintosh ready.

Trinisystem will not run on:
Macintosh System's that do not have a 68000 series processor, such as a PowerPC processor, are not supported.
The Macintosh XL is not supported, due to being more of an Apple Lisa at heart, which causes compatibilty issues in our testing.
